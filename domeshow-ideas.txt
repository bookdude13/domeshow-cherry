40 triangles total
 - 6 pentagons (one of them is on top)
 - 2 sets of 5 eq. triangles

 Patterns:
  - info:
    - Pattern controlled by human
    - intensity controlled separately

  - (1) Completely solid dome color
  - (6) Beach ball of death (a la mac)
  - (4) Horizontal wave (degree offset)
    -  (4.5) Continuous rotation where degree changed
    - bounce back up
  - (8) Penta/hexagons + Triangles (manual control?)
  - (2) full random (+ threshold for colors)
    - random color fade per triangle
    - beat trigger- set fade rate by BPM
  	- solid color fade
  - (3) wave down from top (think target)
    - bounce back up
    - trigger on beat, speed based on BPM
  - (8) Spiral
  - (5) Counter-rotating circles
  - (7) top-half + bottom-half / layers

  Beat detection send a signal to the pattern to do an event
  Patterns can be set by BPM

  Upper intensity limit in software (in case we hit a limit on generator power)
